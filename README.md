# The Legend of Zelda GIF Generator, v1

### Handmade in Orem, UT by [dt](https://github.com/danieltov)

Powered by the Giphy API, this _Legend of Zelda_ GIF Generator is the best place to search and save your favorite _Zelda_ GIFs. The web app is fully responsive, so it works on mobile as well as desktop.

## Using the _Legend of Zelda_ GIF Generator

-   The app comes with five buttons preloaded, allowing you to quickly generate GIFs based on recent _TLOZ_ masterpieces.
-   To generate GIFs from other Zelda games (or, I guess, from any topic) simply enter the game's name in the text field and hit the `return` button. Try "A Link to the Past"!
-   When you tap or click on the `gold colored` game title buttons, 10 GIFs will generate, but don't worry, you can always call for 10 more.
-   Each GIF defaults as a still image â€” simply tap or click to animate it!
-   Under each GIF, you will see two large buttons. The `green button` will allow you to download the GIF directly from Giphy. The `red button` will save the gif to your `Faves`.
-   Harnessing the lower of `localStorage`, your faves will stay stored even if you navigate away from the page or come back later.

## Notes

-   For the best quality, this app loads the original (largest) GIF file of each entry, which means you may have to wait a little to get the GIF going. I believe it's worth the wait.
-   Earlier versions of this app displayed the GIF rating. Version 1 omits this meta-data because _TLOZ_ is a family-friendly franchise so using this app as intended will not render any mature content. Abuse of this app may result in mature content. Which, like, live your best life, you wild thing.
